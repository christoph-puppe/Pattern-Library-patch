# Corrections received

**This file is empty because no request for corrections has been sent.**

It is committed with nothing in it deliberately. `corrections.html` is not built
and will not be built until this file has entries or recorded non-responses,
which is the Gate 8 decision recorded in `BUILD-LOG.md`. An empty corrections
page would imply a review that did not happen.

## The decisions that govern this file

Both are recorded in `BUILD-LOG.md` under Gate 8 and are binding.

1. **Response status is reported by approach, not by person.** Gate 7 removed
   every personal name and every proponent organization from the site. A
   non-response is recorded as, for example, *Catalog-first, option A: asked
   14 August, no response as of 30 September*. Silence is published and dated;
   it is attached to the approach rather than to a person.
2. **A correction is published unedited.** The site states what changed, and does
   not paraphrase the correction itself.

## What to record for each reply

One entry per correction. `corrections.html` renders from this file, so keep the
field names.

```
## Correction <n>

- approach:   catalog-first | assessment-first | component-first | executable-first
- received:   2026-09-01
- corrected:  what they said was wrong, in their words, unedited
- applied:    what changed on the site, and where
- pages:      catalog-first.html, scenario.html
- data:       data/six-questions.json cell 3/catalog-first
- verified:   the check that now covers it, if any
```

## What to record for a non-response

```
## No response <n>

- approach:   component-first
- asked:      2026-08-14
- asked_via:  where the request was sent
- as_of:      2026-09-30
- note:       nothing received. Recorded because silence about a description of
              your own work is information.
```

## The fourth approach

Executable-first was added from a concept note rather than from a published body of
content, so its proponent is the note's author and the request below goes to
them in the same words. The corpus its extracts come from is the site's own,
written by `tools/executable_first_corpus.py` from the CIS Benchmark and the DISA
STIG for Ubuntu 24.04 in the shape the note proposes, so the three judgements
the request names apply with one difference: the extracts were chosen from
files the site wrote, and the judgement worth the most is whether the shape
those files give the note's mechanism, the parts, the props, the links and the
parameters, is the shape the note intends. Two publishers' guidance was
transcribed into that corpus, and `examples/executable-first/README.md` says what
of it is theirs and what is the generator's; a correction from either of them
about the transcription is recorded here in the same form.

## The request that has not been sent

Recorded here so that when it goes out, what was asked is on the record too. The
request is to correct anything about your approach that is wrong.

> This site describes three published bodies of OSCAL content, including yours.
> Its extracts come from published OSCAL files at declared pointers and can be
> re-derived. Encodings, criteria and open questions are maintained as analysis
> content. Three judgements need review beyond the structural checks.
>
> First, section 7 of your approach's page states the case for it as its
> proponents would state it. If that is not the case you would make, that is the
> most useful correction available.
>
> Second, the extracts chosen for each question are provably what your files say.
> Whether they are the fragments you would have chosen is a different question.
>
> Third, every count the site reports is recomputed from your files as they were
> read. If one is wrong, or has been fixed in a version the site has not read,
> please say so.
>
> Corrections are published unedited, with the correction attributed to whoever
> made it. If you would rather not respond, that will be recorded as asked and
> not answered, by approach and by date, because hiding it would not be neutral.
