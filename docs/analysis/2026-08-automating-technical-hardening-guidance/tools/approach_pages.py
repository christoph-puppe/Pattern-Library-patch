approach_pages.py: emit the four approach pages from one template.

Plan section 3 rule 5 requires equal budget across the four approaches
"enforced by construction". Three hand-written pages cannot deliver that: the
one written first sets the shape and the other two drift toward it. So the nine
sections, their order, their heading text and their per-approach counts come
from a single function, and the only thing that varies per page is the prose
that has to vary.

What the template fixes, and what a page therefore cannot change:
    six sections, same order. Section 1's heading is per approach,
      because what each one publishes is the subject of it; the other six
      are the same words on all three pages
    three strengths and three risks in section 2, from data/tradeoffs.json
    no figures anywhere: every count lives on the scenario page
    six question subsections, generated from data/six-questions.json
    three sentences in section 7, same frames on all three pages

What a page supplies:
    the lede, 25 to 60 words, which is the whole summary
    two or three paragraphs per question

Gate 7 removed quotations and proponent attribution from the whole site. No
personal name and no proponent organization appears on any page. An approach is
named by its structural name. Characterizations trace to a JSON pointer into a
shipped file, or to a cited source document.

#  Identical on all three pages. Changing one changes all three.
#  Seven sections, not eight. "SC-28 followed end to end" is gone: the first of
#  the two rules the site walks IS protection of data at rest, sc-28, so section
#  4 now follows it end to end in all three shapes, and the old section followed
#  it through each publisher's own shipped content instead. That made the same
#  point twice, once from our encodings and once from a corpus, and the corpus
#  version dragged publisher-specific identifiers into a walkthrough that is
#  supposed to hold one subject constant. What each group actually ships is on
#  the artifacts page.
#  Tradeoffs open the page. They used to be section 6, two boxes at the foot,
#  which meant a reader met a thousand words of description before being told
#  what the thing is good and bad at. The section that carried them is gone
#  rather than duplicated, and what the pre-read recorded and the two papers do
#  not is carried inside the new block as one line per approach.
#  No figures on these pages. The site describes one scenario, on the page built
#  for it, and every count belongs there: a number quoted here would be a second
#  scenario, implied and unstated. What an approach page carries is the shape of
#  the approach, and tools/verify.py fails the build if a figure appears on one.
#  Four sections. There were five: a per-question walk sat third, restating
#  this approach's column of the six questions with its own prose, its own
#  answer strip and the published extracts. It is gone. The six questions page
#  carries all three columns of that material side by side, which is the
#  comparison a reader is making, and one column of it here was the same
#  content read twice with nothing to compare it against.
#  Section 3 was "Which OSCAL models this touches": a footprint paragraph and
#  the seven-model map with this approach's models outlined. It said where the
#  content lives, which is the first line of the stakeholder mapping above it
#  and the model row on every answer on the six questions page, and it had to
#  disclaim itself in its own caption because a footprint is not a measure of
#  anything. The join chain was nested under it as 3.1 and is the section now.
