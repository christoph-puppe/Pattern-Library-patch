scenario_page.py: emit scenario.html from data/scenario.json.

WHY THIS PAGE EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND.

The four approaches can each express everything the others can. What separates
them is how many documents it takes and what the plan of record ends up holding,
and neither is visible until the same task is put to all four.

That task is described once. Every count on this site lives here: a figure on an
approach page would be a second scenario, implied and never stated, and a reader
comparing two pages would be comparing two different systems without being told.
tools/verify.py fails the build if a figure appears anywhere else.

Nothing here is typed. The framework count is the length of an id list stored in
data/scenario-evidence/, each guide's count is recomputed from the plan it came
from, and the file inventory follows a rule stated per approach. The four
figures are drawn on one grid by tools/diagrams.py.

Usage:
    python tools/scenario_page.py
    python tools/scenario_page.py --out DIR
