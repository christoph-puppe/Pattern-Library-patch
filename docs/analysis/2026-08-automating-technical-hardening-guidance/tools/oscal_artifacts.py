tools/oscal_artifacts.py: author data/oscal-artifacts.json.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The walkthrough encodes two rules ourselves, so the pages argue
from content nobody published. That is the right trade for comparing modelling,
but it leaves a reader with no way to see what the three groups have actually
shipped. This inventory is that: every OSCAL document in the three corpora, what
model it is, and what is in it, counted from the file rather than described. The
fourth approach has shipped nothing, and its section says so.

Nothing here is authored. Every number is read off disk.
