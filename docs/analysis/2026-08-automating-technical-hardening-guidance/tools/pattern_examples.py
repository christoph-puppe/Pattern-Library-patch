tools/pattern_examples.py: author data/pattern-examples.json.

WHAT THIS IS. The three published approaches ship content for different
products, so quoting what each one published means comparing a certificate
control against an object-store rule against a Linux STIG. That is a comparison
of subject matter, not of modelling, which is the only thing this site is for.
The fourth approach has published nothing and exists as a concept note.

So the examples here are ours. Two rules, chosen once, written in all four
shapes. The rules are real: both are Ubuntu 24.04 LTS STIG requirements, with
their published identifiers kept so a reader can look them up. What is authored
is the encoding, and only the encoding.

NAMESPACES ARE NOT OURS. Every prop carries the namespace of the approach whose
pattern it illustrates: AWS's own ns for the catalog shape, the STIG ns for the
assessment shape, the concept note's placeholder ns for the profile shape, and
IBM's proposed first-class assemblies, which need no ns because the whole point
of the proposal is that they are not props. Nothing here invents a namespace.

Run with --check to fail if the committed file is stale.
